# Bin_packing

The bin packing problem involves packing items into bins. However, the bin packing problem has a different objective: find the fewest bins that will hold all the items.

The following summarizes the differences between the two problems:

Multiple knapsack problem: Pack a subset of the items into a fixed number of bins, with varying capacities, so that the total value of the packed items is a maximum.

Bin packing problem: Given as many bins with a common capacity as necessary, find the fewest that will hold all the items. In this problem, the items aren't assigned values, because the objective doesn't involve value.

In this example, items of various weights need to be packed into a set of bins with a common capacity. Assuming that there are enough bins to hold all the items, the problem is to find the fewest that will suffice.
